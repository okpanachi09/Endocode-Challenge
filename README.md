# Endocode Programming Challenge Realization
This repository serves as a realization for the programming assignment set up by endocode as part of the recruitment process. 
In order to tackle the set of tasks required by this challenge, I opted out to use python as the programming language given it's ease of development and the multitude of tools that are readily available for speeding up the development process.

### Third-Party Libraries used within this project: 
in order to provide a clean and easy to maintain solution, I went with flask as a web framework given how clean the flask code base looks. 
 

 ### USAGE :
 * Run the main script
 > python3 src/main.py

* Run the unit tests

in one shell run this : 
> python3 src/main.py

open another shell and run this:
> python3 tests/unittests.py
